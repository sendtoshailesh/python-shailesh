# implemention of a basic ATM machine simulation in Python. We'll make the following assumptions:

### - The ATM has a fixed amount of cash available.
### - Each user has a unique card number and PIN.
### - The user's account balance is stored in a dictionary.
### - The ATM can only perform withdrawal operations.
### - The ATM checks for sufficient balance in the user's account and sufficient cash in the ATM before allowing a withdrawal.
