# Implemention of a basic ATM machine simulation in Python. We'll make the following assumptions:

### - The ATM has a fixed amount of cash available.
### - Each user has a unique card number and PIN.
### - The user's account balance is stored in a dictionary.
### - The ATM can only perform withdrawal operations.
### - The ATM checks for sufficient balance in the user's account and sufficient cash in the ATM before allowing a withdrawal.


```
class ATM:
    def __init__(self, available_cash):
        self.available_cash = available_cash
        self.users = {
            "1234567890123456": {"pin": "1234", "balance": 1000},
            "9876543210987654": {"pin": "5678", "balance": 500}
        }

    def validate_card_and_pin(self, card_number, pin):
        if card_number in self.users and self.users[card_number]["pin"] == pin:
            return True
        return False

    def withdraw_cash(self, card_number, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            return "Invalid amount."

        if amount > self.available_cash:
            return "Insufficient cash in the ATM."

        if amount > self.users[card_number]["balance"]:
            return "Insufficient balance in your account."

        self.users[card_number]["balance"] -= amount
        self.available_cash -= amount
        return f"Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance: {self.users[card_number]['balance']}"

    def display_balance(self, card_number):
        return f"Your current balance is: {self.users[card_number]['balance']}"

def main():
    atm = ATM(available_cash=5000)

    card_number = input("Enter your card number: ")
    pin = input("Enter your PIN: ")

    if not atm.validate_card_and_pin(card_number, pin):
        print("Invalid card number or PIN.")
        return

    while True:
        print("\nATM Menu:")
        print("1. Withdraw Cash")
        print("2. Display Balance")
        print("3. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
            print(atm.withdraw_cash(card_number, amount))
        elif choice == "2":
            print(atm.display_balance(card_number))
        elif choice == "3":
            print("Thank you for using the ATM.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

### **Explanation:**

1. ATM Class:  
   * `__init__`: Initializes the ATM with a fixed amount of available cash and a dictionary of users with their card numbers, PINs, and balances.  
   * `validate_card_and_pin`: Checks if the provided card number and PIN match any user in the system.  
   * `withdraw_cash`: Handles the withdrawal process, checking for sufficient balance in the user's account and sufficient cash in the ATM.  
   * `display_balance`: Displays the current balance of the user's account.  
2. Main Function:  
   * Prompts the user to enter their card number and PIN.  
   * Validates the card number and PIN.  
   * Presents a menu for the user to choose between withdrawing cash, displaying balance, or exiting.  
   * Handles the user's choice and performs the corresponding action.

This implementation covers the basic functionality of an ATM, including validation, withdrawal, and balance display, while handling cases like insufficient balance and insufficient cash in the ATM.
